Construct Tree; // Call from initialization method.

 // Empties old tree.
	// Clears children.
	// Clears entity list.
 // Calculates the new bounds.
 // Sets Root's size, so collision detection will fire properly when all entities are added.
 // Adds all entities from the manager to the octree.
	// Subdivides as necessary.
